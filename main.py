# GRAND QUESTION 1
#     Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980.
#     Explain what you learn from the charts that could help a machine learning algorithm.
# GRAND QUESTION 2
#     Build a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”.
#     Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc)
#     and describe what other models you tried.
# GRAND QUESTION 3
#     Justify your classification model by discussing the most important features selected by your model.
#     This discussion should include a chart and a description of the features.
# GRAND QUESTION 4
#     Describe the quality of your classification model using 2-3 different evaluation metrics.
#     You also need to explain how to interpret each of the evaluation metrics you use.
